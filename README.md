# If It Fits Your Pixel

I really don't know what the hell I'm doing but I want to practice React, JavaScript and TailwindCSS using NeoVIM and not using AI, so here we are. I'm going to try to build a macro tracking web app that pulls data from an open API. I've multiple macro tracking applications in the past, so I'm going to throw out all the features that I hated and make sure to put in all the super cool stuff that I like.

## Feature Roadmap
- Landing Page
- Add Goals
- Add Measurements
- Add Meals
- Add Workouts
- Visualize Data
